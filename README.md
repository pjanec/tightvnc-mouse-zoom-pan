# TightVNC Viewer panning/zooming with mouse

Panning .... CTRL+SHIFT+ALT + LEFT MOUSE BUTTON drag/drop

Zooming .... CTRL+SHIFT+ALT + MOUSE WHEEL up/down


Disabled scrollbars (no need for them with mouse pan/zoom; not worth the effort making them work)

Disabled Window auto-resize when zooming (to keep the view non-jumping while mouse zooming)
